| 2 | Then open the workbook ‘SHS S&OP Forecast Accuracy’ as shown <br> | Workbook is opened. |
| 3 | In the data settings dialogue box select the ‘Forecast Accuracy’ worksheet. Select the ‘S&OP Candidate’ scenario. <br><br> | The scenario is selected. |
| 4 | Make sure that in the data settings for Historical Interval Count is selected 12 months period. This value is used for the MAPE calculation. | 12 months are set in the Data settings. |
| 5 | In the data settings dialogue box , select the tab hierarchy.<br>Click on “Add hierarchy” and select one of the available hierarchies. In this test we will use SHS customer - EMEA<br><br> | Hierarchy is selected.<br> |
| 6 |  To review intervals used for the MAPE calculation and its APE values you can click on the desired Forecast Category, in the Forecast Accuracy worksheet, and the Forecast Accuracy Detail MAPE chart will pop up in the bottom part of the screen.<br> | The  Forecast Accuracy Detail MAPE chart is available.<br> |
| 7 | For the MAPE calculation the tool will take into consideration APE measures available from the chart.<br>Relevant intervals are highlighted in chart in the screenshot. | APE measures are available from the tool and can be used for calculation testing |
| 8 | To calculate the final MAPE value the SUM of APE for last 12 months of Historical Interval Count is taken into consideration, divided by the number of intervals (=Historical Interval Count) which is in this case 12 as mentioned.<br><br>See the attachment for graphical presentation of the formula. | Values needed for the calculation are available from the tool. |
| 9 | Results of calculated MAPE are available in the Forecast Accuracy worksheet. In this example we have calculated MAPE for following:<br>- Forecast Category: SparePartsCS<br>- Lag interval: 1<br>- Historical Interval Count: 12<br>- Hierarchy: SHS Customer - EMEA<br>  | Final calculation is the same as the one generated by the tool. |
